  <h1>JS Atomic 05</h1>

  <h2>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "Error 404"? How about "404 Error"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
  <p>Trying to do arithmetic with a non-numeric string will result in NaN (Not a Number).  If you give it a number first, ("3test" or "3 44545") it will take the initial number.</p>

  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
  <p>When I tried putting in $5 it gave me NaN.</p>

  <h2>Why might you use the increment (++) or decrement (--) operators? What are some applications that you predict might come into play?</h2>
  <p>When you want to increment things? ;) Like scores, times a button was pushed?</p>

  <h2>Please open the console for more!</h2>
