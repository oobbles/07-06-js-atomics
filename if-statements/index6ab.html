<h2>What do you call true and false values?</h2>
<p>Booleans?</p>
<h2>How is true similar or dissimilar from "true"? Can they be used in the same way?</h2>
<p>Not related.  One is a boolean and the other is a string.  No.</p>

<h2><I>6B: Password Game</i></h2>
<h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
<p>I noticed no flexibility.</p>
<h2>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h2>
<p>I tried both and didn't see any difference. (I tried different capitalization and a space at the end.)</p>
<h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
<p>Because anyone can look at it.</p>
