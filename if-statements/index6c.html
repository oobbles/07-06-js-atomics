  <h1>JS Atomic 6c</h1>
  <h2>6C: Guess a Number</h2>
 <p> If you collect the user's input as a string (i.e. without using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), does == work to compare the input to the stored secret number? Would === work? Which is best?</h2>
  If you collect the user's input as an integer (i.e. by using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), can you use == to compare? ===? Which is better in this case?
  What is the difference between == and ===?
  In this case, does it make more sense to leave the user's guess as a string, or to convert it to an integer? Why? What are the relative advantages / disadvantages of each approach (particularly in terms of the types of new features that might be able to be added)?<p>
    <blockquote>
  0==false // true, because false is equivalent of 0<br>
   0===false // false, because both operands are of different type <br>
   2=="2" // true, auto type coercion, string converted into number <br>
   2==="2" // false, since both operands are not of same type<br>
You should always use strict equality operator i.e. === and avoid using == operator even if you need type coercion, instead convert the type by yourself to make it more readable.

<p> I felt the above really summarized what I these questions were leading to- It seems best to always use === and convert the number on purpose, not letting js use auto type coercion. However it seems like it would be easier if you collected "25" and checked to see if it was the same as 25 and it converted it for you.  But really, I think we've established that explicit is usually preferred.
