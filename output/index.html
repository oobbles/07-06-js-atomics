  <h1>JS Atomic 02</h1>

  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>Alert pops open a window, console log seems pretty behind the scenes.</p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>When they make an error or there is an error.  Wrong password.  Closing a page they may not intend.  Etc.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>It forces the user to stop what they are doing and dismiss the box.  Takes them out of the flow of the page, so to speak.</p>

  <h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  <p>No, I didn't even realize it was there.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  <p>Debugging. Grocery lists.</p>

  <h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
  <p>First alert, console log, second alert. All the js runs before the html is displayed.</p>
