  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</li>
      <ul><li>To store information.  To easily change information that is variable.</li></ul>

      <li>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</li>
      <ul><li>Easier when you are reading your code to know what that variable is for.  Longer to type out.</li></ul>

      <li>Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</li>
      <ul><li>To store information we don't have when we write the program, either user input or even things that are dynamically generated.</li></ul>

      <li>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</li>
      <ul><li>var just indicates we are declaring.  After that, I'm assuming it is assigned.</li></ul>

      <li>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</li>
      <ul><li>I did not get an error message in the console.  It just put undefined where the variable was in the code.  <i>I am undefined years old.</i></li></ul>
    </ul>
